# Amethyst

Amethyst doesn't support text-based configuration files,
see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/issues/301).
As a result, this module is used only for installation, not managing configuration.

> NOTE: Just installing isn't sufficient for Amethyst, it needs to be launched via the GUI as well.
> Once launched, it needs to be granted access to certain Accessibility settings in System Preferences.
